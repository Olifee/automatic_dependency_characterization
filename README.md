# Blackbox learning of parametric dependencies for performance models from monitoring data 

This Java project holds classes for:
- creating runtime data sets for multiple algorithms from different domains (e.g., basic Java functionalities, image processing) in order to emulate real monitoring data, 
- learning and predicting the runtime of an application in an online scenario based on observable input parameter values,
- evaluating the prediction performance of various Weka Classifiers for regression in this special scenario
- building a meta-classifier in order to recommend the best fitting prediction technique depending on observable charateristics on the training data set.
